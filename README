A library for monitoring application-wide events in pyqt and playing them back for testing purposes.

Try the example to get a feel for it:

$ cd examples
$ PYTHONPATH=.. python demo_app.py --record
# Do some stuff in the app
# Then use the recording window to save a recording script.
# Then quit.
# If you saved the recording to e.g. /tmp/demo_recording.py, then try this:
$ PYTHONPATH=.. python demo_app.py --playback /tmp/demo_recording.py
